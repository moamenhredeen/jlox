# jlox

jlox is java implementation of the lox programming language from *crafting interpreters book*.
through this project I am trying to achieve the following:
- learn how to design simple programming language
- learn how to write my own parser
- gain deep knowledge about low programming languages
- learn more about new java features by applying them where possible


## TODO
- [ ] fix github action
